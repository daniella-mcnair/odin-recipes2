  <img src="https://somebodyfeedseb.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/2021.01.17-Chickpea-sandwhich-7660.jpg" alt="coronation-chickpea-sadnwich" class="imageSize">
  <p>Who doesn’t love chickpeas? It is quick and easy to make, yet it tastes better than any other coronation sandwich we have had. It has lots of interesting flavours and textures working in perfect harmony. </p>
  <p>Ingredients</p>
    <ul>
      <li>▢bread: we like ciabatta, sourdough or panini rolls, or slices of bread. </li>
      <li>▢chickpeas: we used tinned chickpeas to make this recipe effortless, but if you wish, you can use dried chickpeas. BBC Good Food article here shows various ways to cook your dried chickpeas. A little secret: this recipe works well with butter beans and cannellini beans too.</li>
      <li>▢curry powder: we typically use medium or mild curry powder. 
        oil.</li>
      <li>▢raisins: or sultanas, or chopped dried apricots.</li>
      <li>▢lime or lemon juice.</li>
      <li>▢mango chutney: can be replaced with apricot jam.</li>
      <li>▢fresh coriander: also known as cilantro.You may also add a sliced spring onion (or finely chopped red onion). </li>
      <li>▢chilli pepper: red or green. It may also be replaced with chilli flakes (red pepper flakes).</li>
      <li>▢vegan mayonnaise: if you’re not following a vegan diet, you may use regular mayo, Greek yogurt or creme fraiche.</li>
      <li>▢cucumber & lettuce: sliced into rounds</li>
      <li>▢toasted almond flakes: optional, but it’s a lovely addition for texture.</li>
    </ul>  
  
    <p>Steps</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Separate and wash gem lettuce leaves. You may want to remove or thin the thick stalks of the lettuce. Slice the cucumber into rounds. 

      If using, toast your almond flakes in a dry pan, until slightly browned and starting to smell all nutty. Set aside for later. The almonds are completely optional and are used for extra texture and some nutty flavour. </li>

      <li>Then drain the chickpeas and run some cold water through them to remove any excess sodium and starch. Dap them with a sheet of kitchen paper towel to remove moisture. 

        Heat a large frying pan with a drop of oil, curry powder, add chickpeas and cook stirring continuously for 2-3 min over medium heat, until all chickpeas are well coated and warmed through. Leave aside to cool slightly.</li>

        <li>Finely chop the coriander (including the stalks) and chilli. You can use any chilli you like, but if you can’t handle the heat, remove the seeds.

          In a large mixing bowl, mix vegan mayo (or yoghurt) with mango chutney, lime juice, sultanas, chopped chilli and coriander. Season with salt and pepper. It may look like a lot, but if you make your sandwiches with a large bread roll it will make sure your sandwich isn’t dry. 

          Then add the cooled chickpeas to the coronation dressing and mix well. Crush some of the chickpeas with the back of a fork or a potato masher to thicken the sandwich filler a little bit. Season with salt and black pepper if needed.
          
          
        </li>

        <li>Cut your bread rolls in half lengthways. Place some gem lettuce leaves on the bottom bread slices, then spoon the coronation chickpea mixture and sprinkle with toasted almonds. Top with sliced cucumber and place the other half of the bread on top.</li>
    </ol>
